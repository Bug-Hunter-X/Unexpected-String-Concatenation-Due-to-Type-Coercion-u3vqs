This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to type coercion. The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's loose typing, when a number and a string are passed in, string concatenation happens instead of addition.  The solution provides a method to handle this issue. This is a frequent source of bugs in JavaScript, especially for those coming from strongly-typed languages.
